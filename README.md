Hey! I am Ajay, a PhD student in University of Hyderabad. </br>
I am trained in theoretical chemistry. </br>
I code, read anything (not everything 😉) interesting, and try to experience life.</br>
I get excited when I learn something new, read something interesting, or debug my code.
I am ....
   - 👷 **Currently working on:** </br>
     * _Implementation of OpenMP in reaction dynamics code._
     * _Fitting 3D potential energy surface (PES) using Neural network._
       
   - 📖 **Currently reading**:
      * _Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky_

The tools I have used:</br>
* _Fortran (for scientific programming)_
* _OpenMPI_
* _Bash shell scripting (mostly for automatization)_
* _Python (mostly as a side language to help with data)_
* _TensorFlow + Keras (to write simple Feed forward neural network)_
* _Jupyter Notebook_
